# Operator Marketplace

On OpenShift clusters, the [marketplace-operator](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace) makes off-cluster Quay Appregistry type catalogs available to OLM. It is installed by default with OpenShift.

## Pulling Catalogs From Appregistry

The marketplace-operator can be told to pull a catalog from Appregistry by creating an `OperatorSource`:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorSource
metadata:
  name: my-operators
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  type: appregistry
  endpoint: https://quay.io/cnr
  registryNamespace: my-operators
  displayName: "My Operators"
  publisher: "Me, Myself, and I"
```

- `type` is the registry type (`appregistry` being the only supported type)
- `endpoint` is the Appregistry endpoint
- `registryNamespace` is the name of your Appregistry namespace
- `displayName` and `publisher` are optional and only needed for UI purposes

The creation of an `OperatorSource` results in the creation of an OLM `CatalogSource` in the same namespace the marketplace-operator is running in. This `CatalogSource` will be populated with operators from the `OperatorSource` ready to be managed by OLM.

In versions of OpenShift > 4.2, all `CatalogSources` generated by the marketplace-operator in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace are available for use in all namespaces.

## Configuration

The marketplace-operator is installed by default into the `openshift-marketplace` namespace along with three Red Hat provided `OperatorSources`; `redhat-operators`, `certified-operators`, and `community-operators`, which represent operators published by redhat, ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), and upstream community members respectively.

The default behavior of the marketplace-operator ensures these `OperatorSources` always exist on a cluster, even if they are manually deleted.

You can manually configure which `OperatorSources` the `marketplace-operator` recreates by creating an `OperatorHub` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OperatorHub
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  disableAllDefaultSources: true
  sources: [
    {
      name: "community-operators",
      disabled: false,
    }
  ]
```
